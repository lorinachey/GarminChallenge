# Garmin Challenge
A simple graph challenge for finding a node in a specific graph.
This code is based on the provided information about Node structure and 
some assumptions about the structure of the graph itself, mainly that the
nodes of the graph are stored in an array. The 0th position in the array
is where the root node is stored. The rest of the nodes are stored in level
order from left to right. See Graph class for example.

## Instructions for Running
Download the two files Graph.java and Node.java and keep them in the same directory.

If on Windows, hold shift and right click in the directory where the two files are stored.
Select "Open PowerShell window here..." from the drop down. If on Linux/UNIX based systems,
right click and select the option to open terminal here.

Type the following to compile the program: 
`javac Graph.java`

Type the following to run the program:
`java Graph`
